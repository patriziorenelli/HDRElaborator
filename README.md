# HDRElaborator
## General Description
  Project created for the exam of the Computer Graphics course of the degree in computer science of the "La Sapienza University of Rome".
 ## More details
  The project tries to implement the algorithm in the paper "Exposure Fusion of Tom Mertens, Jan Kautz and Frank Van Reeth", which illustrates one of the possible techniques for superimposing images with different    exposures, saturation and contrast. Exploit Gaussian and Laplanic pyramids. My implementation takes advantage of a Python class that implements all the necessary functions. For more information on my implementation and the results obtained, consult the present documentation.
  I'm sorry but the original documentation and comments in the code were written in Italian. The English version of the documentation has been translated automatically, I do not guarantee its correctness.
